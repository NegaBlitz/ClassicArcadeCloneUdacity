# Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game Clone

This program can be run in the browser, and is a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger. The goal of the game is to reach the water on the other side, which will reset the game upon completion. You have to avoid the angry bugs though, or they will send you back to the start.

## How to run

Simply right-click on index.html and run the web-page in your browser of choice. It will pull the game up and immediately start.

## Other information

The code base was pulled from Udacity's Github and only the ```app.js``` file has been edited by me.
